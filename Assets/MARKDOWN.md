## Project Description
Using Express.js, node, and heroku, I deployed a live application that allows front and back end to work together. You can enter notes, save them, delete notes, and come back anytime to pick up where you left off. Using Express, I created routes that allow for various methods of data updating, deletion, and creation.

## Installation
You can use this page immediately in your browser by visiting the Heroku site.

## Usage
You can take notes, view past notes, and delete past notes quickly and easily!

## Test Instructions
You can install the jest testing package after cloning the code from github.
